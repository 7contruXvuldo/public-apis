One of the most controversial and debated sections of the PPC is section 295-C, which prescribes the death penalty for anyone who defiles the name of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This section was added in 1986 by the military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq as part of his Islamization policy. Since then, many people have been accused, convicted, and executed under this section, often on false or fabricated charges. The section has also been used to target religious minorities, such as Christians and Ahmadis, who are considered heretics by some Muslims.
 
Another important section of the PPC is section 377, which criminalizes "carnal intercourse against the order of nature" with any man, woman, or animal. This section is based on the Victorian morality of the British colonial era and is widely interpreted to outlaw homosexuality. The punishment for this offence is imprisonment for life or for a term not less than two years and not more than ten years, and a fine. However, in practice, this section is rarely enforced and there have been no reported cases of conviction under it in Pakistan.
 
A recent amendment to the PPC that has attracted attention is the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2020, which was passed by the Parliament in February 2020. This act introduced several reforms to the criminal justice system, such as enhancing the protection of women and children from rape and sexual abuse, increasing the penalties for child pornography and cybercrime, establishing special courts for speedy trials of rape cases, and allowing chemical castration as an optional punishment for repeat offenders of rape.
